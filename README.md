# Mushroom-Classifier-with-python
Task proposed by kaggle, the task consist in using a data frame of mushrooms features and you have to chose a Machine Learning Model to predict if the mushroom is edible or not

For use this notebook you will need do dowload the dataset before run the code or it will result in an error,
after dowload the data set put it in the same folder as the code to run it.

That's the fist project maded done on my own, i know it's a little bit annoiyng to dowload the dataset to run the code, but when i make this notebook i was not acquainted with the github, so i hope you understand.

in this project there is nothing special, i'm putting this here because i want to look back, in the future and see my starting point and be thankful for my improvement.
